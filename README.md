# AlignmentComparator

*AlignmentComparator* is a desktop application that visualizes differences between two alternative multiple sequence alignments of the same set of biological sequences and allows to annotate and comment the comparison. This allows life science researchers to decide which alternative alignments to take into account as the bases of e.g. a phylogenetic study or numerous other tasks.
